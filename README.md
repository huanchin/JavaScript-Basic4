# JavaScript-Basic4
This project contains:

1. Set object
2. Map object
3. Coding Challenge


Which data structure to use?

Array:

1. Use when you need ordered list of values (might contain duplicates)
2. Use when you need to manipulate data

Set: 

1. Use when you need to work with unique values
2. Use when high-performance is really important
3. Use to remove duplicates from arrays

Object:

1. More traditional key/ value store (“abused” objects)
2. Easier to write and access values with . and []
3. Use when you need to include functions (methods)
4. Use when working with JSON (can convert to map)

Map:

1. Better performance
2. Key can have any data type
3. Easy to iterate
4. Easy to compute size
5. Use when you simply need to map key to values
6. Use when you need keys that are not srings
